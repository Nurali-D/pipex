# pipex with bonus part
Objectives
Your objective is to code the Pipex program.
It should be executed in this way:
$> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
Just in case: file1 and file2 are file names, cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with
their parameters.
The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:
$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
III.1 Examples
$> ./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
should be the same as “< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile”
$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile
should be the same as “< infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile”
